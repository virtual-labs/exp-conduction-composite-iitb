{"version": 2.0, "questions": [{"question": "A cold storage room has wall made of 0.2m thick layer of brick (k = 0.98W/m-k) on the outside. The middle layer is of 0.09m thick of plastic foam (k = 0.2W/m-k) and 0.015m inside layer wood (k = 0.17W/m-k). The outside and inside convective heat transfer coefficient and temperature are 12W/m-k, 28 C and 29W/m-k, -2.6 C respectively. If the wall area is 90m<sup>2</sup>.Find the total equivalent heat resistance.", "answers": {"a": "0.0025570 k/w", "b": "0.0084510 k/w", "c": "0.0095570 k/w", "d": "0.0032572 k/w"}, "explanations": {"a": "", "b": "", "c": "", "d": ""}, "correctAnswer": "c", "difficulty": "beginner"}, {"question": "In the above question find he heat removed by refrigeration.", "answers": {"a": "-3201.8415 w", "b": "-3435.3454 w", "c": "-3325.2322 w", "d": "-3543.0138 w"}, "explanations": {"a": "", "b": "", "c": "", "d": ""}, "correctAnswer": "a", "difficulty": "beginner"}]}
